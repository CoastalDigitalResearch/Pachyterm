# Model Host PRD

## Overview
The Model Host manages loading and execution of AI models, both local (GGUF, MLC, vLLM) and remote (OpenAI, Gemini), with a focus on low latency and efficient resource utilization.

## Dependencies
- Command Prefix Parser (for receiving prompts)
- Config System (for model configurations)
- Profile Cache (for model-specific settings)
- Streaming UI (for output display)

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Model Loading
- **FR-1.1**: Load local models in GGUF format
- **FR-1.2**: Support MLC and vLLM model formats
- **FR-1.3**: Connect to remote API endpoints (OpenAI, Gemini)
- **FR-1.4**: Implement per-model adapter pattern
- **FR-1.5**: Support model hot-swapping

### 2. Model Execution
- **FR-2.1**: Execute inference with provided prompts
- **FR-2.2**: Apply model-specific parameters (temperature, top-p)
- **FR-2.3**: Handle streaming token generation
- **FR-2.4**: Support batch inference for efficiency

### 3. Resource Management
- **FR-3.1**: Maintain warm pool of N model workers
- **FR-3.2**: Implement memory isolation between models
- **FR-3.3**: GPU memory management for local models
- **FR-3.4**: Automatic model unloading on memory pressure

### 4. Fallback Handling
- **FR-4.1**: Fallback to remote endpoints when local fails
- **FR-4.2**: Configurable fallback chain
- **FR-4.3**: Graceful degradation on resource constraints
- **FR-4.4**: Error recovery and retry logic

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- **NFR-1.1**: Cold-start time ≤ 150ms
- **NFR-1.2**: Agent response latency ≤ 300ms for 32-token prompt (7B model, 4-bit)
- **NFR-1.3**: Support concurrent inference requests
- **NFR-1.4**: Efficient CPU/GPU utilization

### Reliability
- **NFR-2.1**: Model crash isolation
- **NFR-2.2**: Graceful handling of OOM conditions
- **NFR-2.3**: Persistent model cache across restarts

### Security
- **NFR-3.1**: Sandboxed model execution
- **NFR-3.2**: Secure API key storage
- **NFR-3.3**: Memory isolation between requests

## Pre-conditions
- Sufficient memory for model loading
- GPU drivers installed (for local GPU models)
- Network connectivity (for remote models)
- Valid model files or API credentials

## Post-conditions
- Model successfully loaded or connected
- Inference completed within latency bounds
- Resources properly released
- Response streamed to UI

## Edge Cases
1. **Model file corruption**: Validate and report errors
2. **GPU memory exhaustion**: Fall back to CPU or smaller model
3. **Network timeout**: Implement exponential backoff
4. **Incompatible model format**: Clear error messaging
5. **API rate limiting**: Queue and retry management
6. **Concurrent model switches**: Proper synchronization
7. **Malformed model output**: Sanitization and validation

## Success Metrics
- 95th percentile latency < 500ms
- Zero model crashes in 1000 hours
- Successful fallback in 100% of failure cases
- < 8GB memory usage with 7B model

## Testing Requirements
1. Model loading benchmarks
2. Latency testing across model sizes
3. Memory leak detection
4. Concurrent request stress tests
5. Fallback scenario validation
6. API integration tests
7. Resource exhaustion handling
