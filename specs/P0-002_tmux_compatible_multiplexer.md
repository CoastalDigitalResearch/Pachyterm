# tmux-Compatible Multiplexer PRD

## Overview
The tmux-Compatible Multiplexer provides native terminal multiplexing capabilities with full tmux key binding parity, ensuring users can adopt Pachyterm without workflow friction. This component enables horizontal/vertical splits, tabs, and session management.

## Dependencies
- TTY Engine (for managing multiple PTY sessions)
- GPU Renderer (for rendering split layouts)
- Input/Keymap System (for handling multiplexer key bindings)
- Plain-Text Config (for key binding customization)

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Window Management
- **FR-1.1**: Support horizontal and vertical panes within windows
- **FR-1.2**: Create and manage multiple tabs (windows)
- **FR-1.3**: Navigate between panes using keyboard shortcuts
- **FR-1.4**: Resize panes dynamically

### 2. Session Management
- **FR-2.1**: Save and restore session layouts to disk
- **FR-2.2**: Support detached sessions that persist after disconnection
- **FR-2.3**: Attach and reattach to existing sessions
- **FR-2.4**: Name and organize sessions

### 3. Input Handling
- **FR-3.1**: Broadcast input to multiple panes simultaneously
- **FR-3.2**: Support tmux-compatible key bindings (Ctrl-b prefix)
- **FR-3.3**: Allow custom key binding configuration via config file
- **FR-3.4**: Handle copy mode for text selection and scrollback

### 4. Layout Engine
- **FR-4.1**: Implement automatic layout algorithms (tiled, even-horizontal, etc.)
- **FR-4.2**: Support custom layout definitions
- **FR-4.3**: Preserve layout state across sessions
- **FR-4.4**: Handle pane creation and destruction gracefully

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- **NFR-1.1**: Key-dispatch latency p95 ≤ 2 ms
- **NFR-1.2**: Layout serialize/restore round-trip < 5 ms
- **NFR-1.3**: Works efficiently in both GPU and `--no-gpu` modes
- **NFR-1.4**: Minimal memory overhead per pane (< 1MB base)

### Compatibility
- **NFR-2.1**: 100% pass rate on tmux integration test suite
- **NFR-2.2**: Support all common tmux key combinations
- **NFR-2.3**: Compatible with tmux configuration patterns

### Reliability
- **NFR-3.1**: Zero visual artifacts after 24h stress testing
- **NFR-3.2**: Graceful handling of pane crashes
- **NFR-3.3**: Automatic layout recovery after resize events

## Pre-conditions
- TTY Engine initialized and operational
- Renderer supporting multiple viewport management
- Input system capable of prefix key detection
- Configuration system loaded

## Post-conditions
- Multiplexer sessions properly managed
- All panes receive appropriate input
- Layout state synchronized with renderer
- Session persistence data written to disk

## Edge Cases
1. **VT escape-sequence conflicts**: Handle complex terminal escape sequences across panes
2. **Memory exhaustion with deep splits**: Implement lazy grid allocation with hard caps
3. **Rapid pane creation/destruction**: Maintain layout consistency during high-frequency changes
4. **Session corruption**: Recover from malformed session files
5. **Conflicting key bindings**: Resolve conflicts between multiplexer and application shortcuts
6. **Terminal resize during splits**: Maintain proportional layouts during window resize

## Success Metrics
- 100% pass rate on open-source tmux integration test suite
- Zero visual artifacts after 24h soak test with 100 pane create/destroy cycles
- Key binding compatibility verified against top 50 tmux configurations
- Session restore time < 100ms for layouts with up to 20 panes

## Testing Requirements
1. Unit tests for layout algorithms and pane management
2. Integration tests with tmux compatibility suite
3. Stress tests for concurrent pane operations
4. Performance benchmarks for key dispatch latency
5. Session persistence and recovery tests
6. Memory usage validation under extreme split scenarios
