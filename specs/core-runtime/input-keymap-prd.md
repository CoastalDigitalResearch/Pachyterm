# Input/Keymap System PRD

## Overview
The Input/Keymap system handles all keyboard input, provides configurable keybindings, and ensures proper integration with the agent command prefix while maintaining compatibility with native shell keybindings.

## Dependencies
- TTY Engine (for sending processed input)
- Config System (for loading keymap.toml)
- Agent Command Parser (for prefix detection)

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Input Processing
- **FR-1.1**: Capture and process all keyboard input events
- **FR-1.2**: Support modifier keys (Ctrl, Alt, Shift, Cmd/Super)
- **FR-1.3**: Handle special keys (arrows, function keys, etc.)
- **FR-1.4**: Support key repeat with configurable rates

### 2. Keybinding Configuration
- **FR-2.1**: Load keybindings from keymap.toml
- **FR-2.2**: Support action mapping to key combinations
- **FR-2.3**: Allow user-defined custom keybindings
- **FR-2.4**: Provide default keybinding presets

### 3. Command Prefix Handling
- **FR-3.1**: Detect 'p' character only at line start
- **FR-3.2**: Pass through 'p' in all other contexts
- **FR-3.3**: Support escape sequence to type literal 'p' at line start
- **FR-3.4**: Configurable prefix character

### 4. Shell Compatibility
- **FR-4.1**: Preserve native readline keybindings
- **FR-4.2**: Pass through shell-specific key combinations
- **FR-4.3**: Support vi and emacs mode detection
- **FR-4.4**: Handle bracketed paste mode

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- **NFR-1.1**: O(1) keybinding lookup
- **NFR-1.2**: < 0.1ms input processing latency
- **NFR-1.3**: No perceptible delay in regular typing

### Compatibility
- **NFR-2.1**: Must not break native shell keybindings
- **NFR-2.2**: Support all standard terminal key sequences
- **NFR-2.3**: Work with international keyboard layouts

## Pre-conditions
- Keyboard input available from OS
- Terminal in appropriate mode (raw/cooked)
- Keymap configuration loaded

## Post-conditions
- Input processed and appropriate action taken
- Key events properly propagated or consumed
- State consistency maintained

## Edge Cases
1. **Conflicting keybindings**: Priority resolution system
2. **Rapid key sequences**: Proper event queuing
3. **Modifier key stuck**: Detection and recovery
4. **International input methods**: IME compatibility
5. **Copy/paste with special characters**: Proper encoding
6. **Keybinding loops**: Circular reference detection

## Success Metrics
- Zero dropped keystrokes under 200 WPM typing
- 100% compatibility with top 10 shells
- < 1ms latency for keybinding resolution
- Successful operation with 50+ custom keybindings

## Testing Requirements
1. Keybinding conflict detection tests
2. Performance tests for rapid input
3. Compatibility tests with various shells
4. International keyboard layout tests
5. Custom keybinding validation
6. Prefix detection accuracy tests
