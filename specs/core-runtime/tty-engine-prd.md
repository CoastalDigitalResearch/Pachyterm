# TTY Engine PRD

## Overview
The TTY Engine is the foundational component of Pachyterm responsible for spawning and managing pseudo-terminals (PTYs), handling I/O relay, signal management, and supporting various terminal modes.

## Dependencies
- None (foundational component)

## Functional Requirements

### 1. PTY Management
- **FR-1.1**: Spawn and manage pseudo-terminals using async-pty
- **FR-1.2**: Support multiple concurrent PTY sessions
- **FR-1.3**: Handle PTY lifecycle (creation, monitoring, cleanup)

### 2. I/O Relay
- **FR-2.1**: Relay input/output between user interface and PTY
- **FR-2.2**: Support bidirectional data flow with zero-copy buffers
- **FR-2.3**: Handle backpressure and flow control

### 3. Signal Handling
- **FR-3.1**: Properly propagate POSIX signals (SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGWINCH, etc.)
- **FR-3.2**: Handle window resize events
- **FR-3.3**: Support signal masking and custom signal handlers

### 4. Terminal Modes
- **FR-4.1**: Support raw mode for direct character input
- **FR-4.2**: Support cooked mode for line-buffered input
- **FR-4.3**: Support alternate screen buffer mode
- **FR-4.4**: Maintain mode state and transitions

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- **NFR-1.1**: Round-trip echo latency < 1ms under load
- **NFR-1.2**: Zero-copy buffer implementation for I/O operations
- **NFR-1.3**: Minimal CPU overhead for idle terminals

### Compatibility
- **NFR-2.1**: 100% POSIX PTY semantics conformance
- **NFR-2.2**: Compatible with all common shells (bash, zsh, fish, etc.)
- **NFR-2.3**: Support for all standard TUI applications

## Pre-conditions
- Operating system with PTY support (macOS, Linux)
- Rust async runtime initialized
- Valid file descriptors available

## Post-conditions
- PTY successfully created and managed
- All I/O properly relayed
- Clean resource cleanup on termination
- No zombie processes

## Edge Cases
1. **PTY allocation failure**: Gracefully handle when system runs out of PTYs
2. **Broken pipe**: Handle sudden disconnection of child process
3. **Signal storms**: Properly queue and handle rapid signal sequences
4. **Buffer overflow**: Implement backpressure when output exceeds consumption rate
5. **Mode transition conflicts**: Handle requests to change modes during active operations

## Success Metrics
- Zero PTY leaks over 24-hour stress test
- < 0.1% packet loss under maximum throughput
- Successful operation with 100+ concurrent PTYs

## Testing Requirements
1. Unit tests for all PTY operations
2. Integration tests with real shells
3. Stress tests for concurrent PTY management
4. Signal handling edge case tests
5. Performance benchmarks for I/O throughput
